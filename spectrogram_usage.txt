SPECTROGRAM & LOSSY ANALYSIS TOOL — QUICK USAGE GUIDE
====================================================

This tool generates spectrograms and performs heuristic lossy-source analysis.
It does **NOT guarantee** codec identification

BASIC USAGE:
python spectrogram.py audio_file.mp3
python spectrogram.py "My Song.flac" -o output_name.pdf

MODES:
--fast (default)
  • Optimized for speed and inspection
  • Downsamples if needed
  • Decimates display only (analysis remains accurate)
  • Best for quick checks and browsing

--quality
  • Full-resolution spectrogram
  • Higher FFT overlap and DPI
  • Slower but more detailed
  • Best for archival plots and close inspection

--detect
  • Heuristic lossy-source analysis
  • Estimates cutoff frequency and shelf behavior
  • Reports closest matching encoding profile
  • Provides confidence level (low / medium / high)
  • Does NOT guarantee codec or bitrate

OUTPUT OPTIONS:
-o filename          Custom output filename
--no-display         Do not open a plot window
--log                Logarithmic frequency axis (visual aid only)

FORMATS & SPEED:
• PDF is fastest for saving (recommended)
• PNG is slower but supports higher DPI
• Typical DPI values:
    150 = fast / inspection
    300 = high quality

COMMON EXAMPLES:

# Fast spectrogram (default)
python spectrogram.py song.flac

# High-quality spectrogram
python spectrogram.py song.flac --quality --log

# Heuristic lossy analysis with report
python spectrogram.py song.flac --detect --no-display

# Analyze and save report plot
python spectrogram.py song.mp3 --detect -o analysis.pdf

OUTPUT FILES:
• Spectrograms and reports are saved to:
  outputs/spectrograms/

INTERPRETING RESULTS (IMPORTANT):
• "Closest profile" indicates similarity, not certainty
• A detected shelf suggests lossy processing
• No detected shelf ≠ guaranteed lossless
• Confidence reflects strength of evidence, not proof

PERFORMANCE NOTES:
• Analysis speed scales with file duration
• --fast mode is sufficient for codec-shelf detection
• --quality mode is for visualization, not better detection

I tried to make the tool favor transparency over false certainty as best as possible.
